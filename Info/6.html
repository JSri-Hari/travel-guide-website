                    Situated in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand, Kedarnath is a sacred pilgrimage site and one of the Char Dham destinations in Hinduism. Nestled amidst the breathtaking peaks of the Garhwal Himalayas, Kedarnath is revered as the abode of Lord Shiva, one of the principal deities in Hinduism.
                    The focal point of Kedarnath is the ancient Kedarnath Temple, dedicated to Lord Shiva in his form as Kedareshwar. Perched at an altitude of 3,583 meters (11,755 feet) above sea level, the temple is surrounded by snow-capped mountains, 
                    pristine glaciers, and lush meadows, creating a serene and spiritually chargedÂ atmosphere.
