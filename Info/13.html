It is one of the unexplored and virgin places of the South Indian hill station, not yet encroached by the masses of tourists that visit the place every year. Emerald Lake is the ideal spot in Ooty for nature lovers.

                    Located about 12 km away from Coonoor is the Dolphin's Nose about 1,500 meters above sea level. The tip of the peak of this enormous rock resembles a dolphin's nose and this is one of the most visited tourist spots in The Nilgiris District of Tamil Nadu.
It is set amidst the rolling hills of the Nilgiris Hills (or the Blue Mountains). The gigantic rock formation is entirely unprecedented. There are enormous canyons found on both the sides of the destination and there is a clear view of the Catherine Falls, another popular tourist destination with its ongoing current several thousand meters below, which is located at a short distance from the Dolphin's Nose
