                 When Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya after getting victory 
                 over Ravana, Hanumanji started living here. That is why it was named 
                 Hanumangarh or Hanuman Kot. It was from here that Hanumanji used to 
                 protect Ramkot. In the main temple, Pawansut sits on the lap of Mata Anjani.Located in Ayodhya, it is one of the most important temples in the city along with other temples 
                 like Nageshwar Nath and the under-construction Ram temple.
