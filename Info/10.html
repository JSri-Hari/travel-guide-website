                <img src="ayodhya1.1.jpg">
                <p id="t3">
                 When Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya after getting victory 
                 over Ravana, Hanumanji started living here. That is why it was named 
                 Hanumangarh or Hanuman Kot. It was from here that Hanumanji used to 
                 protect Ramkot. In the main temple, Pawansut sits on the lap of Mata Anjani.Located in Ayodhya, it is one of the most important temples in the city along with other temples 
                 like Nageshwar Nath and the under-construction Ram temple.

                <p id="t3">
                    Kanak Bhawan is to the north-east of Ram Janam Bhumi, Ramkot, in Ayodhya. 
                    Kanak Bhawan is one of the finest and famous temples in Ayodhya and is a must visit. 
                    It is believed that this Bhawan was gifted to Devi Sita by Kaikei immediately after her marriage to Lord Ram. 
                    This is private palace of Devi Sita and Lord Rama. Vikramaditya got it renovated. Later it was rebuilt/renovated by Vrish Bhanu Kunwari which exists even today.
                    The main idols installed in the garbhgrih (sanctum), are of Lord Ram and Devi Sita.

                <img src="ayodhya1.3.jpg">
                <p id="t3">
                    At a distance of 10 km from Ayodhya Junction, Guptar Ghat is a holy ghat situated on the banks of River Saryu in Faizabad near Ayodhya. It is one of the popular religious places to visit in Ayodhya.
                    Guptar Ghat holds immense religious significance. According to legend, Guptar Ghat is believed to be the place where Lord Rama meditated and undertook the Jal Samadhi to leave the earth and go back to his original abode 'Vaikunta'. It is a popular belief among devotees that taking a dip in the Saryu river on this ghat will wash away their sins and relieve them from worldly worries. 
                    The ghat resounds with the chants of Lord Rama's name as devotees and priests sing hymns in his praises.
