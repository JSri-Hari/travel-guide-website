                 When Lord Rama returned to Ayodhya after getting victory 
                 over Ravana, Hanumanji started living here. That is why it was named 
                 Hanumangarh or Hanuman Kot. It was from here that Hanumanji used to 
                 protect Ramkot. In the main temple, Pawansut sits on the lap of Mata Anjani.Located in Ayodhya, it is one of the most important temples in the city along with other temples 
                 like Nageshwar Nath and the under-construction Ram temple.

                    Kanak Bhawan is to the north-east of Ram Janam Bhumi, Ramkot, in Ayodhya. 
                    Kanak Bhawan is one of the finest and famous temples in Ayodhya and is a must visit. 
                    It is believed that this Bhawan was gifted to Devi Sita by Kaikei immediately after her marriage to Lord Ram. 
                    This is private palace of Devi Sita and Lord Rama. Vikramaditya got it renovated. Later it was rebuilt/renovated by Vrish Bhanu Kunwari which exists even today.
                    The main idols installed in the garbhgrih (sanctum), are of Lord Ram and Devi Sita.
